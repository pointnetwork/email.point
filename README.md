# Email Example Zapp

Welcome to the Email Example Zapp. This README is a basic guide to getting started with this application.

## Prepare for deployment

Since the Smart Contract used in this application uses `@openzeppelin/contracts` you must install the dependenceis first before you deploy to the site to the network.

```
npm i
```

Start your local Point Node and deploy the Zapp by following the instructions [here](https://pointnetwork.github.io/docs/build-run-dev-node-and-services).
