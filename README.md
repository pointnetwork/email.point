# Email Example Zapp

Welcome to the Email Example Zapp. This README is a basic guide to getting started with this application.

## Prepare for deployment

Since the Smart Contract used in this application uses `@openzeppelin/contracts` you must install the dependenceis first before you deploy to the site to the network.

1. Run `npm i`

You can now deploy the site to the network using the `point-deploy` executable. For details on deploying to the network see this [README](../../deployspace/README.md)
